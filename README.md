# Shiksha Saathi

**Shiksha Saathi** is a multilingual, document-grounded campus chatbot designed to provide students instant, accurate, and accessible responses in their preferred language. Built for **Smart India Hackathon 2025**, it leverages a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** combined with modern LLMs to deliver context-aware, source-linked, and dynamically updated answers while maintaining security, accessibility, and continuous improvement.

## Problem Statement

Campus offices handle hundreds of repetitive queries daily—fee deadlines, scholarship forms, timetable changes—often from students uncomfortable with English or official documentation. Students in rural or regional sectors frequently miss critical deadlines due to language barriers, while staff are burdened by repetitive queries.

**Shiksha Saathi** provides a **dynamic, multilingual, document-grounded solution** that delivers accurate, context-aware responses in the student’s preferred language, prevents misinformation, escalates ambiguous queries to humans, and ensures equitable access to official resources.

---

## Objectives

1. **Student-Centric:** Provide fast, reliable answers to students in English, Hindi, and regional languages.
2. **Accuracy & Trust:** Prevent misinformation through document-grounded retrieval and explicit source linking.
3. **Scalability:** Handle daily uploads of institutional PDFs and circulars dynamically.
4. **Accessibility:** Support visually/hearing-impaired and differently-abled students with voice and visual aids.
5. **Admin-Friendly:** Enable institutions to manage documents, queries, and analytics without coding knowledge.
6. **Continuous Improvement:** Collect and analyze query data to optimize content coverage, detect gaps, and retrain embeddings.

**Process Flow:**

1. Admin uploads PDFs/circulars; pipeline extracts and indexes content.
2. Embeddings stored in vector database (ChromaDB/FAISS).
3. Student submits query via web widget.
4. Backend retrieves relevant content, generates answer using LLM.
5. Response delivered with **source references**; low-confidence flagged for human fallback.
6. Query logged for analytics, continuous improvement, and FAQ optimization.
